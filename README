This plugin will automatically look for cscope.out databases when you open any file.

It does a search starting at the directory that the file is in, and checking the parent directories until it find the cscope.out file.  The idea being that you can start editing a source file deep in a project dir, and it will find the correct cscope database a couple dirs up.
